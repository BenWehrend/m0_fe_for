# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
- Pretty solid as of now, but I plan on practicing more. 
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- Felt good going through these problems. Even though they're more complicated having more base knowledge helps me spin wheels less.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- Going through everything that's been learned to make sure I'm brushed up and ready for mod 1. I have time blocked off all next week for practice.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- Can't think of any at the moment, but I always have my cohort, google, and if need be the instructors on slack.
